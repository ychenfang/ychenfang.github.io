I am a second-year master student in Computational and Applied Mathematics at the University of Chicago. I am honored to be advised by Prof. Mihai Anitescu, Prof. Mladen Kolar and Sen Na on my research.

My research interests are optimization, especially stochastic and nonlinear optimization, and its application in machine learning, statistics and finicial data.

Prior to UChicago, I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics from Xiamen University, where I was advised by Prof. Yingxing Li on my undergraduate thesis.
