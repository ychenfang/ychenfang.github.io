I am a second-year master student in Computational and Applied Mathematics at the University of Chicago. I am honored to be advised by Prof. Mihai Anitescu, Prof. Mladen Kolar and Dr. Sen Na on my research and master's thesis.

My research interests are stochastic nonlinear optimization, numerical linear algebra, high-dimensional statistics, statistical learning and mathematical finance.

Prior to UChicago, I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics from Xiamen University, where I was advised by Prof. Yingxing Li on my undergraduate thesis.
